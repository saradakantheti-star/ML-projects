Business Use Cases
1.	Fraud Detection in Banking & Payments
Problem: Fraud transactions are extremely rare compared to legitimate transactions, causing models to bias toward predicting “non-fraud.”
How your model helps: By assigning higher weights to the minority “fraud” class, the model better detects rare fraudulent activities.
3.	Medical Diagnosis (Rare Disease Prediction)
Problem: Patients with rare diseases make up a tiny fraction of hospital records.
How your model helps: Adjusting class weights increases the recall for the rare disease class, ensuring fewer missed diagnoses.
4.	Churn Prediction in Subscription Businesses
Problem: In SaaS or telecom, most customers stay, so churn events are rare.
How your model helps: Weighted logistic regression ensures churn cases are predicted more accurately, improving retention efforts.
5.	Defect Detection in Manufacturing
Problem: Most produced items pass inspection, but defective items (minority class) are costly if missed.
How your model helps: Weighting defective class increases detection sensitivity without over-rejecting good items.
6.	Cybersecurity (Intrusion Detection)
Problem: Most network activity is safe; only a small fraction are attacks.
How your model helps: By giving higher weight to “attack” class, the model improves detection of rare but critical security breaches.

Alternatives to Weighted Logistic Regression
1.	Resampling Techniques
Oversampling minority class (e.g., SMOTE – Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
Undersampling majority class to balance data
2.	Ensemble Models
Use Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost with built-in class weight handling
3.	Anomaly Detection Methods
Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or Autoencoders for extreme imbalance cases
4.	Cost-Sensitive Learning
Custom loss functions that penalize false negatives more heavily
5.	Threshold Tuning
Adjusting classification threshold after training to optimize for precision/recall trade-offs
